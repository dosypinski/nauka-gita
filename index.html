            <div class="song-verse">I'm tired of being what you want me to be<br>
            Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface<br>
            Don't know what you're expecting of me<br>
            Put under the pressure of walking in your shoesTadek<br>
            Every step that I take is another mistake to you<br>
            (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)<br>

            <div class="song-chorus">I've become so tomato<br>
            I can't feel you there<br>
            Become so tired<br>
            So much more aware<br>
            I'm becoming tomato<br>
            All I want to do<br>
            Is be more like me<br>
            And be less like you<br>
            lalalala

            <div class="song-verse">Can't you see that you're smothering me<br>
            Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?<br>
            'Cause everything that you thought I would be<br>
            Has fallen apart right in front of you<br>
            Every step that I take is another mistake to you<br>
            (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the tomato)<br>
            And every second I waste is more than I can take<br>

            I may end up failing too<br>

            You were just like me with someone disappointed in you<br>
